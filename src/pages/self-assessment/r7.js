          Since you have symptoms or have been exposed to COVID-19, get tested at an assessment centre, participating pharmacy, or participating
          community lab. Rapid antigen/self-test kits are only available for those without symptoms

        <p>
          If you think you have a cold or the flu, you should still get tested or talk with a doctor. Symptoms are
          similar to COVID-19.
        </p>
        <h4>If you know when you were exposed to a COVID-19-positive person</h4>
        <p>
          Get tested 7 days after being exposed (stay in isolation during these days). Make an appointment and go to the
          nearest testing location for a COVID-19 test.

          This is called <strong>self-isolation</strong>. You could be carrying the virus without knowing it and spread

        <p>Stay home for 10 days. The 10 days start from the date you began feeling symptoms.</p>

        <h4>If you were exposed to a COVID-19-positive person</h4>
